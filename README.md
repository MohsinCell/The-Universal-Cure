A mysterious virus has plunged humanity into chaos, and the fate of the world rests in your hands. Each chapter holds a challenge, a test of your intellect and resolve. Will you uncover the secrets, solve the riddles, and bring salvation to a desperate world?

## How It Works
1. Read the guide provided in the **Chapter 0**.
2. Solve the puzzle at the end of each chapter to earn the password for the next.

## Note
- All chapters except the cover and the first are password-protected.
